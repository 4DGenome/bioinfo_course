    "## FASTQ files\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplistically speaking the output of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) machines are reads. These are stored in FASTQ files, which get this name from the [FASTQ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) in which reads are written. Essentially, a FASTQ file has millions of the following blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO: USE A FASTQ OF OURS**\n",
    "```\n",
    "@D00733:172:CA8BAANXX:8:2211:1214:2222 1:N:0:AACCAG\n",

    "1. unique read ID plus sequencing information (Illumina machine, index...)\n",
    "2. read sequence\n",
    "3. irrelevant waste of space...\n",
    "4. per-position quality\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quality control of the raw reads\n",
    "\n",
    "FASTQ files as obtained from the sequencer, typically referred to as \"raw reads\" are passed to programs which assess the quality of the reads in many ways. One of the most commonly used of such programs and the one we use is [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), which generates web-like reports (exampls of [good](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/good_sequence_short_fastqc.html) and [bad](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/bad_sequence_fastqc.html) data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making sense of reads\n",
    "\n",
    "Reads themselves do not tell much so there are some steps that are commonly performed in order to make sense of ChIP-seq data (many of them are common to many \\*seq applications although each of them will require specific variations):\n",
    "- trimming of technical sequences and low-quality ends\n",
    "- alignment to the genome reference sequence\n",
    "- generation of read counts profiles\n",
    "- identification of regions of signal enrichment (aka peaks or binding sites)\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are illustrated [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-MXr-KyKmm6a1JOQnM0bUFSNGM)."

    "# File formats explained\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many HTS-related file formats out there (too many indeed!) so here we will only cover those used in this session.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BED format\n",
    "\n",
    "A tab-delimited no-header format to define the genomic coordinates and (optionally) some attributes of a set of genomic features. In its simplest form it has 3 mandatory fields:\n",
    "```\n",
    "chr22\t1000\t5000\n",
    "chr22\t2000\t6000\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fields:\n",
    "1. chromosome\n",
    "2. feature start\n",
    "2. feature end\n",
    "\n",
    "A [BED file](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1) can have 9 additional fields/columns, which allow embedding additional attributes as we will see next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## narrowPeak format\n",
    "\n",
    "A format generated by the [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/) project to provide ChIP-seq peaks. It derives from the BED format and has the 3 first fields defining the genomic coordinates plus 7 more fields with information on the peaks (see [here](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format12)). As we will see later, besides the genomic coordinates fields, the fields we pay more attention to are the 'signalValue' (signal enrichment) and the 'qValue' (significance).\n",
    "\n",
    "## bigWig\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, *\"the [bigWig format](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format6.1) is for display of dense, continuous data\"*. Here specifically is used to represent the number of read counts, preferably normalised, in genomic bins (i.e. ChIP-seq signal). Unlike the two previous formats, which can opened as a text file (yet this is not recommended as they can be very big!), bigWigs are binary files and cannot be opened."

    "## Access to the CRG cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the analyses we will perform in this session can be run locally from your computer. However, there are several reasons to perform them in the CRG cluster:\n",
    "- programs we will use (and other you may want to use in the future) are already installed\n",
    "- more powerful\n",
    "- lab data are stored there\n",
    "- data are backed up\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal): you are now in the command line! To connect to the CRG cluster by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh ...\n",
    "# password =\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Unix environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unix environment works very similar to the Windows/Mac/Ubuntu file systems:\n",
    "- there are files and directories\n",
    "- directories can have other files/directories within\n",
    "- one can move down/up through directories\n",
    "- files/directories can be created, copied, moved and deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use now Unix built-in functions/programs to both illustrate these concepts and prepare the data for this session. By the way, right now you are now in what it is called your *home* directory in the CRG cluster.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Creating a directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in `mkdir` function will allow us to create a directory for this course:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir bioinfo_course\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- avoid blank spaces; alternatives:\n",
    "    - bioinfo_course\n",
    "    - bioinfo-couser\n",
    "    - bioinfo.course\n",
    "    - bioinfoCourse\n",
    "- avoid characters others than letters and numbers\n",
    "- avoid file names starting with a number\n",
    "- (personally) all lower-case\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this session has been previously compiled in the `session01` directory, which is stored somewhere else in the CRG cluster. We will make a copy of the `session01` directory into the `bioinfo_course` you just created in your *home*.\n",
    "```\n",
    "cp -r /users/project/4DGenome/bioinfo_course/session01 bioinfo_course\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `cp` is the built-in function to copy files/directories\n",
    "- `-r` is an option that modulates the behaviour of `cp` (options are explained in more detail later)\n",
    "- `/users/project/4DGenome/bioinfo_course/session01`: path to directory that is being copied (it should be read as `session01` is within `bioinfo_course`, which is within `4DGenome`, which is within `project`, which is within `users`)\n",
    "- `bioinfo_course`: directory in which `session01` will be copied\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving into it\n",
    "\n",
    "We can move into the directory we just copied with `cd`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd bioinfo_course/session01\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Listing files and directories\n",
    "\n",
    "Now can use the `ls` function to see the content of the current directory:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of most Unix functions can be modulated by passing them different options. For instance, if we use:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls -l -t -h\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `ls`: lists files and directories\n",
    "- `l`: shows content as a list together with additional information (e.g. size, last time edited)\n",
    "- `t`: sorts the date of the last edit\n",
    "- `h`: shows size in human-readable units (i.e. KB, MB...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above can be compressed as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls -lth\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can learn about additional options with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "man ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "- man can be applied to any Unix function (we already saw it with `cp -v`)\n",
    "- you can quit the manual page with by typing `q`\n",
    "\n",
    "By default `ls` lists the content in the current directory, but it can also used to list the content in any directory:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls -l data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can go as down as you want in the path, for instance:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls -l analysis/overlap_peaks\n",
    "```\n",
    "This directory is still empty so nothing is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## README\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspecting the content within the `session01` directory reveals the `README.html` --the very same file you are reading now! We could have named this file with any name. However, including a [README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) file is a convention computing people use to say \"hey, here you will find information it is worth reading to start with\". README files are normally just plain text (\\*.txt) or [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (\\*.md) files (the latter format enables some text formatting, which makes reading easier); here I have converted it to an HTML file for the sake of showing it online.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Viewing, editing and executing code\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have executed code by either typing or pasting commands into the terminal. For convenience, code is typically packed into executable text files called scripts. The scripts used in this session are here:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls -l scripts\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `*.sh` termination is a convention to indicate that they are unix shell executables files. We can see the code in the script with the `cat` function, which prints the content of a non-binary file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cat scripts/hello_world.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `#!/bin/bash`: this line is called the [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) and you will see it, or variations of it, at the beginning of in many scripts\n",
    "- `echo \"Hello, world\"`: the `echo` function will print the quoted text that follows it (\"Hello, world\" in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, `cat` does not allow editing its content, something that can be done with a text editor. There are many text editors. I personally like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and I recommend you installing it for this session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, scripts can be executed just by typing its name:\n",
    "```\n",
    "hello_world.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "You probably got the following error:\n",
    "```\n",
    "-bash: hello_world.sh: command not found\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is because `hello_world.sh` is not in your current directory but within `scripts`. We can execute it directly from the current directory, that is, no need to use `cd`, with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "scripts/hello_world.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relative vs absolute paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative paths are paths **relative** to current directory, e.g.:\n",
    "```\n",
    "scripts/hello_world.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "On the other hand, absolute paths include **all** the directories above (the `pwd` function shows the absolute path of the current directory); for instance:\n",
    "```\n",
    "/users/GR/mb/jquilez/bioinfo_course/session01/scripts/hello_world.sh\n",

    "ls -l scripts/overlap_peaks.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's go through the different steps performed by the script by looking at it. For the firs time I recommend you executing the code by copying small bits of code and pasting them onto the terminal. This is good to understand what each bit is doing. Alternatively, all the commands of a script are executed at a time by running the script:\n",

    "    - the part that is to the left of the `=` is the awk-specific variable name\n",
    "    - the part that is to the right of the `=` is the awk-specific variabla value, which can be a text string, a number or even the value of a Unix variable as we are using it here\n",

    "- `-v min_enrichment=$min_enrichment`: another awk-specific variable is defined\n",

    "    - the value of column 7 > the `min_qval` awk-specific variable\n",
    "    - the value of column 9 > the `min_enrichment` awk-specific variable\n",
    "- `|`: this is called a pipe in Unix terms and it is a way to concatenate steps, in other words, here we are telling Unix \"do not yet print the subset rows, we are gonna do something else\"\n",
    "- this *something else* is excluding rows containing some text\n",
    "    - `grep` is another Unix built-in function to find rows that match a text/pattern\n",

    "    - `\"chrM\\|chrY\\|chrUn\\|luciferase\"`: we can pass more than 1 text/patterns to match or avoid, in this case all the chromosomes we want to skip\n",
    "- `>`: prints the rows left to the `$tfile1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Peaks overlap**\n",
    "\n",
